# \<ft-connect-front-end-sdk-tool\>

This is a fixture that lets developers drive instances of the various FileThis Connect drop-in components, like [ft-connect-expand-out](https://github.com/filethis/ft-connect-expand-out) and [ft-connect-tabbed](https://github.com/filethis/ft-connect-tabbed).

After developers enter their FileThis API key and API secret, they can create a user account and a user access token which is injected into a drop-in instance. The instance can then communicate with the FileThis services on behalf of the user.
